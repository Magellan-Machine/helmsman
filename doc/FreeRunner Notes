# FREERUNNER and THE MAGELLAN MACHINE

## WiFi

On boot, the Freerunner should create, or try to connect to an Ad-Hoc network
without encryption called "Magellan". It will take IP address 192.168.2.1.

You should create an Ad-hoc network on your laptop with the same settings,
and use a static IP address like 192.168.2.2.

You should then be able to ssh to the freerunner (ssh root@192.168.2.1)

The disadvantage of the Ad-hoc network is that you can not access the Internet
from your laptop. There is a script on the Freerunner in /root/wifi/lewin.sh
that I used to connect the Freerunner to my home network.

## USB

When plugging the USB cable in the FreeRunner, the FR will go on, and a new 
network device should be visible from your hosting system. Use `dmesg | tail` 
to find what's the new network interface, if you are unsure.

Configure your new interface for static IP (192.168.0.200).

You should now be able to log into the FR with `ssh root@192.168.0.200`. It
might take a little while to prompt you for the password / log you in.

## GPS

GPS can be accessed over DBus. I tested it with cli-framework, a command line
interface to the FSO (Freesmartphone) API over dbus.

See the file 'gpsStuff2' for a dump of my session with the GPS. The position
was about 20m off, but then it didn't see the entire sky, and had not been 
on for very long.

## Accellerometers

See the acc.py ('python acc.py') program which reads the accellerometer 
values and prints time, x, y, z, sum.

## Configuration scripts

There are two parameters that can be modified for USB: if the Freerunner is 
a device (as when it is connected to a laptop with USB networking), or a host
(as when it is connected to the Arduino). Also, if the Freerunner supplies 
power on the USB connection or not.

*Freerunner - Computer*
Freerunner is device, not supplying power.

*Freerunner - Arduino*
Freerunner is host, supplies power to Arduino.

*Freerunner - Arduino - External Power*
Using a special USB cable with three plugs, the Freerunner and the Arduino 
are powered from external power. Freerunner is host but does not supply power.

I have made scripts USB-host, USB-device, powerExternal and powerFromFreerunner
to change these settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Connectivity problems

*The wireless network device on the FR is down*
    ifdown eth0
    ifup eth0
sould do the trick

*I get `eth0: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device`*
The problem might be in the `/etc/network/interfaces`: check out that
the wireless subsistem is brought up at boot time (`/root/wifi/wifi-on.sh`) 
and that the interface is brought up too automatically at boot-up 
time (`auto eth0`).

*I would like to add my own network to those automatically recognised*
Edit the `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`. You can find
plenty of how-to's on how to do this on the internet. You could also use
the `wpa_cli` command to have an interactive session. If you are using
and hidden SSID, you have to set ap_scan to 2 (`ap_scan=2`).

*I swear I did everything right... why it still doesn't work?*
That's a mistery, but in some cases doing a powerdown and powerup (so, 
NOT a reboot) makes things work.
